## Gatsby excels at creating static _sites_

### It's possibly even what got you into Gatsby!

---

## React, GraphQL, and NodeJS

### üòç

---

## GraphQL at **build** time

---

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query GetMyDataPlease {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        pageTitle
      }
    }
  }
`
```

---

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
function App({ data }) {
  return <h1>{data.site.siteMetadata.pageTitle}</h1>
}
```

---

## source plugins supercharge this idea

---

### `gatsby-source-wordpress`

### `gatsby-source-contentful`

### `gatsby-source-graphql`

### [insert your data layer here]

<FaChevronDown size={48} color="#663399" />

### Query it with GraphQL at build time

---

## `gatsby-source-graphql`

### Some of you may have a GraphQL endpoint

---

## Tired

### Writing a source plugin for _every_ data source

## Wired

### Using `gatsby-source-graphql` for GraphQL APIs

---

export default FullScreenCode

```js
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-source-graphql',
  options: {
    typeName: 'GitHub',
    fieldName: 'github',
    url: 'https://api.github.com/graphql',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `bearer ${process.env.GITHUB_API_TOKEN}`,
    },
  },
}
```

---

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query GetGithubDataEzPz {
    github {
      repository(owner: "dschau", repo: "gatsby-mail") {
        stargazers {
          totalCount
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

### Gatsby is truly excellent for static sites

### ... but!

---

## It's excellent for web apps, too.

### ü§î

## Let's move _beyond static_, but first!

---

export default SectionInverted

## What even _is_ a web app?

---

## Dynamic data?

---

## Client-side JS interactions?

## Animations?

---

## Authentication?

---

## Service workers?

## A manifest file?

---

## ... using _the_ platform?

---

---

## Dynamic data?

### By default, with the full power of the React ecosystem

### Gatsby is _just_ React

---

## Hydration

### Often overlooked, Gatsby isn't _just_ static.

### It's SSR rendered (to static content) with a React runtime

### React picks up where we left off

---

## Pick up where we left off

### üîë

---

## The best of both üåé

### Statically rendered: maximize SEO, TTI, general web perf., easy global distribution, etc.

### Dynamic web app: fetch data, authentication, dynamic interactions, etc.

---

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
class DynamicAmirite extends Component {
  render() {
    const { data } = this.props;
    const { moreData = [] } = this.state;
    return (
      <ul>
        {
          data.allYourData.edges
            .concat(moreData)
            .map(({ node }) => <li key={node.id}>{node.text}</li>)
        }
      </ul>
    );
  }
}
```
---

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
class DynamicAmirite extends Component {
  async componentDidMount() {
    const latest = data.allYourData.latest
    const moreData = await fetch(`/your-endpoint/data?latest=${latest}`)
      .then(response => response.json())

    this.setState({
      moreData
    })
  }
}
```
---

## Once hydrated:

### Gatsby produces create-react-app

---

## A Gatsby "site" is a hybrid app

### Static site + dynamic runtime = üòç

---

## Render as much, up front, as possible _statically_

### Then: pick up where we left off

---

## Traditional app-like features are easier than you think

---

## Use cases for web apps

---

## Authentication

### ‚úÖ

---

### Auth0

### Passport.js

### Your own, in-house solution

### If there's an API for it, you can implement authentication

---

1. Render a static shell (as much as possible!)
1. Use an `Authentication` provider to restrict content that shouldn't be visible
1. Once authenticated, show content, use auth data to call APIs, etc.

---

## The App Shell model

### Load a shell (possibly from service worker)

### _then_ fetch data dynamically

---

export default SplitHeight

<Shell />
<Shell server={true} />

---

## Dynamic Data

### ‚úÖ

---

## `apollo-client`

## `componentDidMount`

---

export default SplitHeight

<Shell fetch={true} />

<!-- TODO: get animation working and only start on mount -->

---

## Fetch as much data, up front, as possible

### Then: hydrate, and fetch more

---

## The _best_ of both üåé

### Maximize perf. but keep content up-to-date

---

<Image src="static/images/facebook.gif" />

---

## e-commerce

### ‚úÖ

---

## Oftentimes, data is more static than initially realized

### Additionally: gatsby provides great tooling to get some easy wins

---

## Again:

### Fetch as much data, as possible

### Pick up where we left off

---

## Gatsby provides plugins, patterns, libraries, and more

### Use them!

---

## `gatsby-image` = üíú

---

<Image src="static/images/gatsby-image.gif" />

---

## Progressive Web App

### ‚úÖ

---

### Blazing fast performance, by default üîã ‚ö°

### Offline = `gatsby-plugin-offline`

### Manifest = `gatsby-plugin-manifest`
